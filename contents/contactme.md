In order to be fair to all those seeking my time, I institute frequent office hours. Time and location of office hours may change on a weekly basis, however. So, please, double check the calendar below before planning to meet.

These hours are first come, first serve. To get a general idea of how busy a given time will be, you can [check my office hours sign-up document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nphkPMxB2rjABxm6pPzBZ1eQ-skGTg2lpacqQQuFrU/edit). If you know you’re planning to come on a particular day, feel free to put your name on it to help me know how busy it will be. If my door is open, even if I am speaking with somebody, you should come in and sit on the couch. You may hear something that will be useful in your own work (or maybe even have something to offer to help the other student!). If the door is closed, hang out in the common area outside my office, I’ll be with you soon. Let me know if you're planning to come online, because I only have [the Zoom link](https://umn.zoom.us/my/lanayarosh) up by special request.
